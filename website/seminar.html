        <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
        In the densest subgraph problem, given an undirected graph G(V;E;w) with non-negative edge weights we are asked to find a subset of nodes S from V that maximizes the degree density w(S)=|S|. </br>
        This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and in general is well studied. But what happens when we are asked questions such as "how can we find a dense subgraph in Twitter with lots of replies and mentions but no follows?", "how do we extract a dense subgraph with high expected reward and low risk from an uncertain graph"? </br>
        In this work, specifically, we formulate both problems mathematically as special instances of dense subgraph discovery in graphs with negative weights. We prove that the problem in general is NP-hard, but we also provide sufficient conditions under which it is poly-time solvable. We design an efficient approximation algorithm that works best in the presence of small negative weights, and an effective heuristic for the more general case. Finally, we perform experiments on various real-world datasets that verify the value of the proposed primitives, and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. </br>

        <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
        This work investigates the interplay between different types of user interactions on Twitter, with respect to predicting missing or unseen interactions. For example, given a set of retweet interactions between Twitter users, how accurately can we predict reply interactions? Is it more difficult to predict retweet or quote interactions between a pair of accounts? Also, which features of interaction patterns are most important to enable accurate prediction of specific Twitter interactions? </br>
        Our empirical study of Twitter interactions contributes initial answers to these questions. We have crawled an extensive dataset of Twitter accounts and their follow, quote, retweet, reply interactions over a period of a month. Using a machine learning framework, we find we can accurately predict many interactions of Twitter users. Interestingly, the most predictive features vary with the user profiles, and are not the same across all users. For example, for a pair of users that interact with a large number of other Twitter users, we find that certain "higher-dimensional" triads, i.e., triads that involve multiple types of interactions, are very informative, whereas for less active Twitter users, certain in-degrees and out-degrees play a major role. Finally, we provide various other insights on Twitter user behavior. </br>
