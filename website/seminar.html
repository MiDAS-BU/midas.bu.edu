		 <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
		 In the densest subgraph problem, given an undirected graph G(V;E;w) with non-negative edge weights we are asked to find a subset of nodes S from V that maximizes the degree density w(S)=|S|. </br>
		 This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and in general is well studied. But what happens when we are asked questions such as "how can we find a dense subgraph in Twitter with lots of replies and mentions but no follows?", "how do we extract a dense subgraph with high expected reward and low risk from an uncertain graph"? </br>
		 In this work, specifically, we formulate both problems mathematically as special instances of dense subgraph discovery in graphs with negative weights. We prove that the problem in general is NP-hard, but we also provide sufficient conditions under which it is poly-time solvable. We design an efficient approximation algorithm that works best in the presence of small negative weights, and an effective heuristic for the more general case. Finally, we perform experiments on various real-world datasets that verify the value of the proposed primitives, and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. </br>

		 <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
		 This work investigates the interplay between different types of user interactions on Twitter, with respect to predicting missing or unseen interactions. For example, given a set of retweet interactions between Twitter users, how accurately can we predict reply interactions? Is it more difficult to predict retweet or quote interactions between a pair of accounts? Also, which features of interaction patterns are most important to enable accurate prediction of specific Twitter interactions? </br>
		 Our empirical study of Twitter interactions contributes initial answers to these questions. We have crawled an extensive dataset of Twitter accounts and their follow, quote, retweet, reply interactions over a period of a month. Using a machine learning framework, we find we can accurately predict many interactions of Twitter users. Interestingly, the most predictive features vary with the user profiles, and are not the same across all users. For example, for a pair of users that interact with a large number of other Twitter users, we find that certain "higher-dimensional" triads, i.e., triads that involve multiple types of interactions, are very informative, whereas for less active Twitter users, certain in-degrees and out-degrees play a major role. Finally, we provide various other insights on Twitter user behavior. </br>

<summary> Click for abstract</summary>
<p>
We consider the following problem, which is useful in applications such as joint image and shape alignment.  The goal is to recover \( n \)
discrete variables \( g_i \in \{0, \ldots, k-1\} \) (up to some global offset) given noisy observations of a set of their pairwise
differences \( \{g_i - g_j \bmod k\} \); specifically, with probability \( \frac{1}{k}+\delta \) for some \( \delta > 0 \) one obtains the correct
answer, and with the remaining probability one obtains a uniformly random incorrect answer.  We consider a learning-based formulation
where one can perform a query to observe a pairwise difference, and the goal is to perform as few queries as possible while obtaining the
exact joint alignment.  We provide an easy-to-implement, time efficient algorithm that performs \( O(n \lg n/\delta^2 k) \) queries, and recovers the
joint alignment with high probability.  We also show that our algorithm is optimal. This work improves significantly work of Chen and Candes, 
who view the problem as a constrained principal components analysis problem that can be solved using the power method.  Our approach is simpler both in the algorithm and the
analysis, and provides additional insights into the problem structure. Finally, experimentally our algorithm performs well compared to the algorithm of Chen 
and Candes both in terms of accuracy and running time.

 <details>
 <summary>Click for abstract</summary>
 <p>
  In this work, we tackle the problem of real-time monitoring of dynamic variations of global Internet using topology changes information provided by combining several BGP feeds. We develop a geometric approach that leverages notions of geometric curvature and recent development in graph embedding using Ollivier-Ricci curvature. In particular, we use our method to detect major events and changes via the geometry of the embedding of the graph, where a major event is defined as an incident that either impacts a substantial number of prefixes or can be observed by numerous route monitors within a given period of time. We first describe the Ricci curvature approach to characterize the AS level graph. The key idea is to detect changes in between consecutive snapshots and to separate events that result in considerable geometric alterations, from those that remain local. The variations of curvature are evaluated through a set of landmarks as reference points. We then introduce an anomaly tracking mechanism to detect large variations of curvature that translate into major variations in the geometry of the graph. These changes are then considered as major BGP-level events. We describe a mechanism for identifying the network elements responsible for the set of coordinated changes and isolate their implications in the geometric space. We finally evaluate this system in operational setting.

<summary> Click for abstract </summary>
<p>
We present SPuManTE, an efficient algorithm for mining significant patterns from a transactional dataset. SPuManTE controls the Family-wise Error Rate: it ensures that the probability of reporting one or more false discoveries is less than an user-specified threshold. A key ingredient of SPuManTE is UT, our novel unconditional statistical test for evaluating the significance of a pattern, that requires fewer assumptions on the data generation process and is more appropriate for a knowledge discovery setting than classical conditional tests, such as the widely used Fisher’s exact test. Computational requirements have limited the use of unconditional tests in significant pattern discovery, but ut overcomes this issue by obtaining the required probabilities in a novel efficient way. SPuManTE combines UT with recent results on the supremum of the deviations of pattern frequencies from their expectations, grounded in statistical learning theory.

</details></td><td>Non-Backtracking Cycles: Length Spectrum Theory and Graph Mining Applications
<details>
<summary> Click for abstract </summary>
<p>
Two basic tasks in graph analysis are: (1) computing the distance between two graphs and (2) embedding of the graph elements (i.e., nodes or links) into a lower-dimensional space. The former task has numerous applications from k-nearest neighbor search, to clustering a collection of graphs, to transfer learning. Unfortunately, there exists no canonical way of computing the distance between two finite graphs because the dissimilarity problem is ill-defined. Despite this fact, the relevant literature contains many methods for measuring graph distance with different heuristics, computational efficiency, interpretability, and theoretical soundness. We introduce a graph distance, called the Non-Backtracking Spectral Distance (NBD), which is theoretically sound and interpretable. NBD is based on a mathematical construct from algebraic topology (in particular, homotopy theory) called the length spectrum. The length spectrum of a graph is a function defined on the graph's first homotopy group (a.k.a. the fundamental group); and it uniquely characterizes a graph's 2-core up to isometry. Thus, if two graphs have the same length spectra, then their 2-cores are isometric. We show the relationship between a graph's length spectrum and its non-backtracking cycles; and present a method based on computing the eigenvalues of a graph's non-backtracking matrix. For the second task (i.e., graph embedding), most existing methods are stochastic and depend on black-box models such as deep networks. Both of these characteristics make their output difficult to analyze. We propose the Non-Backtracking Embedding Dimensions (NBED) for finding a graph embedding in low-dimensional space by computing the eigenvectors of the non-backtracking matrix. Both NBD and NBED are interpretable in terms of features of complex networks such as hubs, triangles, edge centrality, and communities. We showcase the usefulness of both NBD and NBED in experiments on synthetic and real-world networks.

<details>
<summary> Click for abstract </summary>
<p>
We consider the product ranking challenge that online retailers face when their customers typically behave as “window shoppers”: they form an impression of the assortment after browsing products ranked in the initial positions and then decide whether to continue browsing. Further, customers’ product preferences and attention spans are correlated and unknown to the retailer. We develop a class of online explore-then-exploit algorithms that prescribe a ranking to offer each customer, learning from preceding customers’ clickstream data to offer better rankings to subsequent customers. Our algorithms balance product popularity with diversity: the notion of appealing to a large variety of heterogeneous customers. We prove that our learning algorithms rapidly converge to a ranking that matches the best-known approximation factors for the offline, complete information setting. Finally, we partner with Wayfair - a multi-billion dollar home goods online retailer - to estimate the impact of our algorithm in practice via simulations using actual clickstream data, and we find that our algorithm yields a significant increase (5-30%) in the number of customers that engage with the site.

</details></td><td>Temporally Biased Sampling & Online Model Management <details> <summary> Click for abstract </summary>
<p>
To maintain the accuracy of supervised learning models in the presence of evolving data streams, we provide temporally-biased sampling schemes that weight recent data most heavily, with inclusion probabilities for a given data item decaying over time according to a specified ``decay function’’. We then periodically retrain the models on the current sample. Time-biasing lets the models adapt to recent changes in the data while---unlike in a sliding-window approach---still keeping some old data to ensure robustness in the face of temporary fluctuations and periodicities in the data values. In addition, the sampling-based approach allows existing analytic algorithms for static data to be applied to dynamic streaming data essentially without change. We provide and analyze both a simple sampling scheme (T-TBS) that probabilistically maintains a target sample size and a novel reservoir-based scheme (R-TBS) that is the first to provide both control over the decay rate and a guaranteed upper bound on the sample size. The R-TBS and T-TBS schemes are of independent interest, extending the known set of unequal-probability sampling schemes. We discuss distributed implementation strategies; experiments in Spark illuminate the performance and scalability of the algorithms, and show that our approach can increase machine learning robustness in the face of evolving data.
