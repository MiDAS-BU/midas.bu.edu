		 <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
		 In the densest subgraph problem, given an undirected graph G(V;E;w) with non-negative edge weights we are asked to find a subset of nodes S from V that maximizes the degree density w(S)=|S|. </br>
		 This problem is solvable in polynomial time, and in general is well studied. But what happens when we are asked questions such as "how can we find a dense subgraph in Twitter with lots of replies and mentions but no follows?", "how do we extract a dense subgraph with high expected reward and low risk from an uncertain graph"? </br>
		 In this work, specifically, we formulate both problems mathematically as special instances of dense subgraph discovery in graphs with negative weights. We prove that the problem in general is NP-hard, but we also provide sufficient conditions under which it is poly-time solvable. We design an efficient approximation algorithm that works best in the presence of small negative weights, and an effective heuristic for the more general case. Finally, we perform experiments on various real-world datasets that verify the value of the proposed primitives, and the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. </br>

		 <span class="bold">Abstract:</span> </br>
		 This work investigates the interplay between different types of user interactions on Twitter, with respect to predicting missing or unseen interactions. For example, given a set of retweet interactions between Twitter users, how accurately can we predict reply interactions? Is it more difficult to predict retweet or quote interactions between a pair of accounts? Also, which features of interaction patterns are most important to enable accurate prediction of specific Twitter interactions? </br>
		 Our empirical study of Twitter interactions contributes initial answers to these questions. We have crawled an extensive dataset of Twitter accounts and their follow, quote, retweet, reply interactions over a period of a month. Using a machine learning framework, we find we can accurately predict many interactions of Twitter users. Interestingly, the most predictive features vary with the user profiles, and are not the same across all users. For example, for a pair of users that interact with a large number of other Twitter users, we find that certain "higher-dimensional" triads, i.e., triads that involve multiple types of interactions, are very informative, whereas for less active Twitter users, certain in-degrees and out-degrees play a major role. Finally, we provide various other insights on Twitter user behavior. </br>

<details>
<summary> Click for abstract</summary>
<p>
We consider the following problem, which is useful in applications such as joint image and shape alignment.  The goal is to recover \( n \)
discrete variables \( g_i \in \{0, \ldots, k-1\} \) (up to some global offset) given noisy observations of a set of their pairwise
differences \( \{g_i - g_j \bmod k\} \); specifically, with probability \( \frac{1}{k}+\delta \) for some \( \delta > 0 \) one obtains the correct
answer, and with the remaining probability one obtains a uniformly random incorrect answer.  We consider a learning-based formulation
where one can perform a query to observe a pairwise difference, and the goal is to perform as few queries as possible while obtaining the
exact joint alignment.  We provide an easy-to-implement, time efficient algorithm that performs \( O(n \lg n/\delta^2 k) \) queries, and recovers the
joint alignment with high probability.  We also show that our algorithm is optimal. This work improves significantly work of Chen and Candes, 
who view the problem as a constrained principal components analysis problem that can be solved using the power method.  Our approach is simpler both in the algorithm and the
analysis, and provides additional insights into the problem structure. Finally, experimentally our algorithm performs well compared to the algorithm of Chen 
and Candes both in terms of accuracy and running time.

<td> Monitoring the Internet through Riemannian Geometry </br>
 <details>
 <summary>Click for abstract</summary>
 <p>
  In this work, we tackle the problem of real-time monitoring of dynamic variations of global Internet using topology changes information provided by combining several BGP feeds. We develop a geometric approach that leverages notions of geometric curvature and recent development in graph embedding using Ollivier-Ricci curvature. In particular, we use our method to detect major events and changes via the geometry of the embedding of the graph, where a major event is defined as an incident that either impacts a substantial number of prefixes or can be observed by numerous route monitors within a given period of time. We first describe the Ricci curvature approach to characterize the AS level graph. The key idea is to detect changes in between consecutive snapshots and to separate events that result in considerable geometric alterations, from those that remain local. The variations of curvature are evaluated through a set of landmarks as reference points. We then introduce an anomaly tracking mechanism to detect large variations of curvature that translate into major variations in the geometry of the graph. These changes are then considered as major BGP-level events. We describe a mechanism for identifying the network elements responsible for the set of coordinated changes and isolate their implications in the geometric space. We finally evaluate this system in operational setting.

<p>
In this work, I will talk about our on going efforts to collect and analyze large amounts of public Whatsapp data from political groups in Brazil, India, and Indonesia. I will discuss our efforts in monitoring a large number of whatsapp groups and provide insights on various problems arising from such data. I will specifically give examples of novel ways in which misinformation, hate speech and coordination are being spread through whatsapp. I will briefly discuss some of the technical challenges that arise from data, specifically related to identifying image based misinformation. Finally, I will mention our efforts on collecting data across platforms for the Indian election and why such a cross platform analysis is required to understand the spread of  issues like misinformation.
