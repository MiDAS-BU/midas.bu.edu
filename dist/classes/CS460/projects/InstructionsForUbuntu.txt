Instructions for Ubuntu

Step 1 — Installing MongoDB

Ubuntu’s official package repositories include an up-to-date version of MongoDB, which means we can install the necessary packages using apt.

First, update the packages list to have the most recent version of the repository listings:

Execute:
sudo apt update

Now install the MongoDB package itself:

Execute:
sudo apt install -y mongodb

This command installs several packages containing the latest stable version of MongoDB, along with helpful management tools for the MongoDB server. The database server is automatically started after installation.

Next, let’s verify that the server is running and works correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2 — Checking the Service and Database

The installation process started MongoDB automatically, but let’s verify that the service is started and that the database is working.

First, check the service’s status:

Execute:
sudo systemctl status mongodb
You’ll see this output:

Output

● mongodb.service - An object/document-oriented database
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mongodb.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2018-05-26 07:48:04 UTC; 2min 17s ago
     Docs: man:mongod(1)
 Main PID: 2312 (mongod)
    Tasks: 23 (limit: 1153)
   CGroup: /system.slice/mongodb.service
           └─2312 /usr/bin/mongod --unixSocketPrefix=/run/mongodb --config /etc/mongodb.conf
According to systemd, the MongoDB server is up and running.

We can verify this further by actually connecting to the database server and executing a diagnostic command

Execute this command:

mongo --eval 'db.runCommand({ connectionStatus: 1 })'
This will output the current database version, the server address and port, and the output of the status command:

Output

MongoDB shell version v3.6.3
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 3.6.3
{
        "authInfo" : {
                "authenticatedUsers" : [ ],
                "authenticatedUserRoles" : [ ]
        },
        "ok" : 1
}

A value of 1 for the ok field in the response indicates that the server is working properly.

Next, we’ll look at how to manage the server instance.

Step 3 — Managing the MongoDB Service

MongoDB installs as a systemd service, which means that you can manage it using standard systemd commands alongside all other sytem services in Ubuntu.

To verify the status of the service, type:

sudo systemctl status mongodb


You can stop the server anytime by typing:

sudo systemctl stop mongodb


To start the server when it is stopped, type:

sudo systemctl start mongodb


You can also restart the server with a single command:

sudo systemctl restart mongodb


By default, MongoDB is configured to start automatically with the server. If you wish to disable the automatic startup, type:

sudo systemctl disable mongodb


It’s just as easy to enable it again. To do this, use:

sudo systemctl enable mongodb
